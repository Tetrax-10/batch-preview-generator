## FAQ

### 1. What are segments `-s`, `--segments`?

Segments are small videos extracted from the input video with a duration specified by `--sduration`. For example, if you set `--segments` to **10** and `--sduration` to **2**, each segment will be **2** seconds long. Therefore, the total duration of the preview will be **20** seconds, as **10** segments each contribute **2** seconds.

### 2. From which part of the video are the segments extracted?

Let's say you set `--segments` to **3** and `--sduration` to **5**. In this scenario, the input video is evenly split into **3** parts, and the first **5** seconds from each part are extracted for previews. Subsequently, these segments are concatenated and converted into a single video or gif. Thus the resulting preview will be of **5x3 = 15 seconds**.

The red parts are extracted for previews

## Development

##### Environment setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Tetrax-10/batch-preview-generator
cd batch-preview-generator
pip install termcolor progress pyreadline3 pyinstaller
```

##### Run

```sh
python preview.py <args>
```

##### Build executable

```sh
pyinstaller preview.spec
```

Make sure to add your "dist" folder to the PATH so that when you run preview, it refers to your "dist" executable. Additionally, also ensure that the path of the installed "preview.exe" is removed during development.

The installer is compiled with the [Inno Setup Compiler](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php), and there's no need to perform this step during the development of Batch Preview Generator, as it is only used for distribution

</br>

### Known bugs

1. When this program is installed and uninstalled it leaves this string ";;" in PATH environmental variable, it's not an issue as it doesn't affect the env vars but its a bloat, So please help me fix this as I'm not good with Inno Setup Compiler

### Assist required

1. I don't have an AMD gpu to implement H/W acceleration
2. Help me fix the `known bugs`
